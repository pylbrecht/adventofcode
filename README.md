My personal solutions of the "Advent of Code" puzzles.
(See https://www.adventofcode.com/)

Dependencies
------------
I'm using [pytest](https://www.pytest.org/) for writing and running my tests.
```Shell
pip install pytest
```

Tests
-----
Run the [pytest command line script](http://pytest.org/latest/usage.html#usage-and-invocations)
from the project's root directory to run all tests.
```Shell
py.test
```
